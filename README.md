# Testing Ruby code - Enumerables

This is the first project from the "testing your code" activity. It's based on the Enumerable Methods solo project, made by Microverse student [Matheus Silva](https://github.com/matheus-fls), as part of the Ruby part of the main curriculum.

In this second version, RSpec based tests were added and applied to the methods.

This project was developed by [Oscar Nava](https://github.com/oscarnava) and [Matheus Silva](https://github.com/matheus-fls) as a Team.
